# MCCG
**TL;DR:** Author Name Disambiguation (AND) suffers from noisy heuristic graphs and the lack of joint representation–clustering optimization. We propose MCCG, a multi-view contrastive and cluster-guided framework that strengthens robustness to graph noise and unifies representation learning with clustering-based disambiguation. By leveraging homogeneous paper clustering and dynamically refining reliable cluster labels, MCCG learns more discriminative embeddings. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that MCCG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
